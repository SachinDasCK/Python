Learning Python From Scratch
===================================
- Functions Perform something when called up on 
- Dictionaries are key and value pairs included in {}
  Eg:  dict = {"name": "beau", "color": "blue"}
- List Used to store multiple items in a single variable in []
  ○ Eg food = ["pizza", "carrots", "eggs"]
  ○ dinner = random.choice(food)
- Python Libraries are set of useful function- so that we don’t have to write code from scratch
- Import statement are used to import libraries used at the top of a program
- Adding f in starting of () in print helps to add variables inside string "" in format - {variables}
